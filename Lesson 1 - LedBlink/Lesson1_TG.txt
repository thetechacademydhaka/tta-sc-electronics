REFER TO THE MAIN CODE


Code : 

-Make the led blink faster than before
-Make the led blink slower than before 
-Turn the led off
-Turn the led on

-Write a program to make a 
   - red color
   - blue color
   - green color



Schematic : 


-Make changes in the arduino code to make the led blink. (Teacher changes circuit)
-Add a third led in the circuit similar to the previous one 
-Make the circuit using a single ground (bb concepts)
-Make the circuit using the power bus terminal (bb concepts)
-Make the circuit using no ground from arduino pins (digitalWrite 0 is gnd!!!)

-Build the circuit of using an RGB light
-Refer to ***
-Change the color of the light from your circuit only with changing the code



TOPLAN

-Make the whole circuit 
-Write the blink code from sratch
-Make a combination of blinking leds


***progression should be interesting, put gaps and use other elements to keep up the fun learning technique
