REFER TO MAIN CODE


CODE:


-Set up the following circuit as shown
-Run the program and press the switch
-Put the switch wire to pin number 8 and see if any values are received
-Make changes in the program to make it correct


SCHEMATIC:

-Make the circuit without using the 5v pin from arduino( digitalWrite HIGH)
-Make the circuit without using gnd from arduino
-Add an led and a resistor as done in previous lesson and connect the led pin to pin7 on arduino
-Make the led turn on when the switch is pressed and off when not pressed
-Make the led blink when the switch is pressed


TOPLAN

-Write code and make circuit from scratch
-Add a second switch and led and do the on/off sequence for it
