CODE:

-Make the servo's shaft go to its full angle 
HINT : (180 is max)
-Make it go half its full angle
-Change the pin to another one of your choice and make it work
HINT : IF NOT PWM WILL NOT WORK
HINT : PWM Concepts ( wavy sign on digital pins)

-Write a program such that when the distance sensor crosses 10 to 20cm led lights on,if not the led lights off**
-Add to your current program that when the distance crosses the range the servo goes to its full angle, if not it goes to 0
(HINT : use map function)
