REFER TO THE MAIN CODE

Code (temp_serial): 

-Change the threshold of the temperature 
-Change the analog pin to a different pin
-Make the system print "HIGH TEMPERATURE" when it crosses the limit, and print "LOW TEMPERATURE" when it goes below the limit
(Hint : use "" while giving input as text in serialprintln)
-Do the above for differnt thresholds
-See the code named fire_alarm_led_bar and build the circuit WITHOUT using a schematic
-Check the pins in your schematic and in your program and then upload the code

Schematic : 

-Change the analog pin to A5 and make changes in your program
-Use digital pins as power and ground

TOPLAN

-Write the program from scratch
-Build the schematic
