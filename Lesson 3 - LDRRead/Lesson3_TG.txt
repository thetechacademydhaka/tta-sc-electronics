REFER TO MAIN CODE

**serial.println(value);

CODE 2:


-Write a program such that as the ldr crosses 400 it prints 1 and below 400 it prints 0
-Write a program as above, but make it print ABOVE LIMIT and BELOW LIMIT
-Change the program to make the led go brighter as ldr value increases
-Similarly, do the same as above but inverse
-Change the brightness of the led using IF and ELSE statements
-With the second led setted up, write a program to make one led increase its brightness an the other one decrease its brightness as ldr value changes


Schematic :

-Make changes in the circuit to take readings from a different pin
-Change the led to a different pin and make it work
-Make the circuit without using gnd from arduino
-Setup a second led
-Make the ciruit using least number of wires as possible
