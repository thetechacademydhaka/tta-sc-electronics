CODE:

-Change the pin number of the sensor different pin
-Write a program such that IF the motion sensor is active it serial prints "Intruder" and when not active it gives "NORMAL"
-Write a program such that when motion is detected the led turns on.
-Change the program such that the buzzer noise is half of the sound as before, as motion is detected
(HINT : analogWrite())

SCHEMATIC:

-Add an led as shown in the figure and follow ***
-Make the circuit using no GND
-Make the circuit using no POWER
-Try out the second code


TOPLAN

-Write code and make circuit from scratch
